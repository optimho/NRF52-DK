#Project notes to the repo
This is a git repo that contains examples for the nrf52

To ensure that this works, navigate to the examples folder in the nRF52 SDK folder and make a folder called my_projects and pull these into that folder, 
then they will look similar to my setup.

For some additional basic notes follow

Use putty and select serial and a speed of 115200.
The serial device will be something like this /dev/ttyUSB0

To find the device run the dmesg command then plug in the ftdi device and rund that command again, that should indicate the name of the last device
plugged in. 

Windows, just use the device manager to see what com port is occupied by the ftdi device, point putty at that com port.
